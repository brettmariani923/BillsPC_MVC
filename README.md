MVC vs Blazor Comparison Website

This project showcases a website implemented twice — once using ASP.NET MVC and once using Blazor — with the goal of comparing these two web development frameworks from Microsoft. By building the same website with both approaches, this project highlights their differences in architecture, development style, performance, and user experience.
Overview

The website provides the same functionality and UI in two parallel implementations:

    MVC Version: Uses ASP.NET Core MVC with traditional Razor views and controllers.

    Blazor Version: Uses Blazor Server (or Blazor WebAssembly) with component-based architecture.

This allows developers and learners to see how the same app can be built differently, and to evaluate pros and cons of each framework.


Features

    Fully functional website built twice

    Shared UI/UX and features between versions

    Easy toggle or navigation to compare MVC and Blazor outputs

    Clean, maintainable codebases demonstrating framework-specific patterns

Technologies Used

    ASP.NET Core MVC

    Blazor Server (or specify Blazor WebAssembly if applicable)

    C#

    Razor syntax (Views & Components)

    Bootstrap (for styling)

    Entity Framework Core (if applicable for data)

Key Differences

| Aspect            | MVC                                      | Blazor                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rendering         | Server-side rendering, full page reloads | Client/server-side rendering with components and partial updates            |
| Architecture      | Model-View-Controller pattern            | Component-based architecture                                                |
| Interactivity     | More postbacks, form submits             | Rich, reactive UI with SignalR (Blazor Server) or WebAssembly (Blazor WASM) |
| State Management  | Stateless between requests               | Persistent UI state in components                                           |
| Development Style | Separate controllers and views           | Razor components with C# logic inline                                       |
| Learning Curve    | Traditional, widely known                | Newer, component-focused                                                    |
| Performance       | Typically faster initial load            | Faster interactions post-load                                               |


This project is ideal for developers who want to:

    Learn and compare ASP.NET MVC and Blazor side-by-side

    Understand the tradeoffs between traditional server-rendered apps and modern component-based frameworks

    Decide which framework better suits their project requirements
