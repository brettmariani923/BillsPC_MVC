    <p>
        Welcome to my Pokémon Database! This website provides detailed information on all Pokémon species up to Generation 8, covering a total of 926 Pokémon.
    </p>

    <p>
        The base stats and all other Pokémon data — such as types, abilities, and additional attributes — are stored in my own database. This database contains every column of information except for the images.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pokémon images are dynamically retrieved from <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokeAPI</a>, a reliable public API that provides official artwork and sprites.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help with searches, if you’re unsure of the exact spelling of a Pokémon's name, just type the first letter and the site will suggest results close to your input.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to provide an easy-to-navigate, searchable, and accurate resource for Pokémon fans and collectors. We hope you find it useful!
